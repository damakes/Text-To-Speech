# Text To Speech
This program converts text from the "tieto.txt" file into an audio file. It is implemented using the Python gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library. The audio file is saved with the name "out.mp3" in the "output" directory, depending on the language. The "tieto.txt" file is located in the same directory as the reader program.
